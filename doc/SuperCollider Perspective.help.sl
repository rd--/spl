# SuperCollider Perspective

Procedure arguments are written `:` prefixed immediately following the opening brace and are terminated by `|`.
Temporary variables are written between `|` markers.

The assignment operator is `:=` not `=`.
The equality operator is `=` not `==`.
The identity operator is `==` not `===`.
The inequality operator is `~=` not `!=`.
