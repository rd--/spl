# Small Kansas

Small Kansas is an experimental graphical interface for the experimental [_Simple Programming Language_].

It includes a library for communicating with the _SuperCollider_ synthesiser.

To play a synthesiser program open the [_World Menu_] and from there open the [_Program Browser_].

Navigate to a program, then open the context menu of the [_Text Editor_] and select 'Play It (Enter)'.

To reset the synthesiser select 'Reset Synthesiser (.)'.

To get help about a word, for instance _SinOscFb_, select 'Help For It (h)'.

To see the implementations of a word, for instance _playEvery_, select 'Implementors Of It (m)'.

Text in brackets, for instance _[Simple Editor]_, indicates that the bracketed text is the name of a help document,
which can be visited the same way.
