# System Browser

A [Column Browser] where column one lists the _Types_ the system knows of.

Column two shows the qualified method names for all of the methods implemented at the selected type,
including the methods implemented at the _Traits_ the type implements.

For clarity the methods of the _Object_ trait are omitted from the list.

When a method is selected the text pane shows the definition of the method.

The _Status Text_ shows the _Traits_ the selected type implements.
