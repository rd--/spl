# Type Browser

A [Column Browser] where column one lists the _Types_ the system knows of.

Column two shows the qualified method names for all of the methods implemented at the selected type.
The list includes only the methods implemented directly at the _Type_, not methods imported from _Traits_ the type implements.

When a method is selected the text pane shows the definition of the method.

The _Status Text_ shows the _Traits_ the selected type implements.
