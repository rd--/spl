Simple Programming Language is a notation for working with a minimal procedural language.
The language consists of lexically scoped closures with mutable environments, record types, and a non-local return mechanism.

Notes from a [SuperCollider Perspective], a [Smalltalk Perspective], and a [Scheme Perspective].
