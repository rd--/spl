# Control Procedures

Control structures are ordinary procedures, as in Smalltalk.

The arguments to _if_, _while_, _timesRepeat_ &etc. must be delayed manually.

The notation to delay a value _x_ is _{ x }_.

[Trailing Procedure Syntax] allows control structures to be written as _(p).if { q } { r }_ and _while { p } { q }_.
