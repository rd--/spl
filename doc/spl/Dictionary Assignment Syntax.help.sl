# Dictionary Assignment Syntax -- syntax

There is dictionary assignment syntax for both temporary variable initialisers:

	| (x, y, z) = (x: 1 * 2, y: 3 * 4, z: 5 * 6); | [z, y, x] = [30, 12, 2]

and for variable assignment:

	| x y z | (x, y, z) := (x: 1 * 2, y: 3 * 4, z: 5 * 6); [z, y, x] = [30, 12, 2]

* * *
