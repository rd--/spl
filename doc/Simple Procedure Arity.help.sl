# Simple Procedure Arity

The expression _squared(3)_ can be implemented by providing a variable arity procedure _squared_ that dynamically checks how many arguments it receives and dispatches to the appropriate place in the [Method Table].

It is one of the properties of the simple model that the procedures that implement the model are of a type that the model does not allow.

The simple model encourages a style of writing that makes programs more like Smalltalk programs, using literal blocks as parameters to methods that require behaviours.
