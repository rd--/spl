# permutationCycles

- _permutationCycles(aPermutation)_

Answer a disjoint cycle representation of _aPermutation_.

Cyclic form of a permutation list of length 3:

```
>>> [3 2 1].permutationCycles
[[1 3]]
```

Permutation with two three-cycles:

```
>>> [4 1 5 2 6 3].permutationCycles
[1 4 2; 3 5 6]
```

Permutation with three two-cycles:

```
>>> [6 4 5 2 3 1].permutationCycles
[1 6; 2 4; 3 5]
```

Cyclic form of a permutation list of length 10:

```
>>> [2 5 3 6 1 8 7 9 4 10]
>>> .permutationCycles
[1 2 5; 4 6 8 9]
```

Identity permutation list, written with unary cycles:

```
>>> 1:5
>>> .permutationListToPermutationCycles(false)
[1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
```

When applied to a `Permutation` object the answer has unary cycles removed:

```
>>> let p = 1:5.asPermutation;
>>> p.cycles
[]
```

The cyclic form of a permutation list of length 6:

```
>>> [6 3 2 5 4 1].permutationCycles
[1 6; 2 3; 4 5]
```

Permutation cycles with unary cycles deleted can be considered a sparse representation of permutation lists:

```
>>> let l = [
>>> 	02 03 01 04 05 06 07 08 09 10
>>> 	12 11 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
>>> ];
>>> l.permutationCycles
[1 2 3; 11 12]
```

A histogram of the cycle count for the permutations of the symmetric group _S6_:

```
>>> let p = 1:6.permutations;
>>> let k = p.collect { :each |
>>> 	each
>>> 	.permutationListToPermutationCycles(
>>> 		false
>>> 	)
>>> 	.size
>>> };
>>> k.asBag.sortedElements
[1 -> 120, 2 -> 274, 3 -> 225, 4 -> 85, 5 -> 15, 6 -> 1]
```
