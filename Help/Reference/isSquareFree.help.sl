# isSquareFree

- _isSquareFree(n)_

Answer `true` if the integer _n_ is square free, else `false`.
An integer is square free if it is divisible by no perfect square other than `one`.

Test whether a number is square free:

```
>>> 10.isSquareFree
true
```

The numbers 4 and 20 are not square free:

```
>>> 4.isSquareFree
false

>>> 20.isSquareFree
false
```

The number `one` is by convention taken to be squarefree,
`zero` is not:

```
>>> 1.isSquareFree
true

>>> 0.isSquareFree
false
```

The first few squarefree numbers are after `one`:

```
>>> 2:33.select(isSquareFree:/1)
[
	 2  3  5  6  7 10 11 13 14 15
	17 19 21 22 23 26 29 30 31 33
]
```

A number is squareful, or nonsquarefree, if it contains at least one square.
The first few squareful numbers are:

```
>>> 1:52.select { :each |
>>> 	each.isSquareFree.not
>>> }
[
	 4  8  9 12 16 18 20 24 25 27
	28 32 36 40 44 45 48 49 50 52
]
```

A number that is divisible by a square is not square free:

```
>>> 12.divisible(4)
true

>>> 12.isSquareFree
false
```

In the prime factorization of a square-free number, the exponents of primes are all 1:

```
>>> 210.isSquareFree
true

>>> 210.factorInteger
[2 -> 1, 3 -> 1, 5 -> 1, 7 -> 1]
```

`primeNu` is equal to `primeOmega` for square-free numbers:

```
>>> 14.isSquareFree
true

>>> 14.primeNu = 14.primeOmega
0
```

`moebiusMu` is zero for non-square-free integers:


```
>>> 12.isSquareFree
false

>>> 12.moebiusMu
0
```
