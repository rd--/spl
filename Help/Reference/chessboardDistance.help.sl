# chessboardDistance

- _chessboardDistance(u, v)_

Answer the chessboard distance,
also called the Chebyshev distance,
between the two vectors _u_ and _v_.

Chessboard distance between numeric three-vectors:

```
>>> [1 2 3].chessboardDistance([2 4 6])
3
```

Equivalent to _âŒˆ|u-v|_:

```
>>> ([1 2 3] - [2 4 6]).abs.max
3
```

At five vectors:

```
>>> [1 5 2 3 10].chessboardDistance(
>>> 	[4 15 20 5 5]
>>> )
18
```
