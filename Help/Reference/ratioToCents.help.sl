# ratioToCents

- _ratioToCents(aNumber)_

Answer the size of the interval represented by the ratio _aNumber_ in _cents_.
There are 1200 cents in an octave.

The perfect fifth is 702 cents:

```
>>> 3/2.ratioToCents
701.995

>>> (3 / 2).log2 * 1200
701.995
```

The octave is 1200 cents:

```
>>> 2.ratioToCents
1200
```

The equal tempered major fourth,
and hence tone and semitone:

```
>>> 2.cubeRoot.ratioToCents
400

>>> let a = [1 2.cubeRoot].geometricMean;
>>> let b = [1 a].geometricMean;
>>> [a b].ratioToCents
[200 100]
```

One step in 16-EDO is 75Â¢:

```
>>> (2 ^ (1 / 16)).ratioToCents
75
```
