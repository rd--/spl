# ++

- _c₁ ++ c₂_
- _c.++_

The binary case is the operator form of `concatenation`.

```
>>> [1 2 3] ++ [4 5 6]
concatenation([1 2 3], [4 5 6])
```

The unary case is the operator form of `catenate`:

```
>>> [1 2 3; 4 5 6].++
catenate([1 2 3; 4 5 6])
```

Where supported `++` is displayed as ⧺.

_Note:_
In Smalltalk the binary form is the comma operator.
