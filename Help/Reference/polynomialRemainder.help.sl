# polynomialRemainder

- _polynomialRemainder(p₁, p₂)_

Answer the remainder of the polynomials _p_.

At `List`,
which must be an ascending list of coefficients:

```
>>> [-42 0 -12 1].polynomialRemainder(
>>> 	[-3 1]
>>> )
[-123]

>>> [3 5 6 -4 1].polynomialRemainder(
>>> 	[1 2 1]
>>> )
[-14 -23]

>>> [5 4 3 2].polynomialRemainder(
>>> 	[-7 0 6]
>>> )
[17/2 19/3]
```
