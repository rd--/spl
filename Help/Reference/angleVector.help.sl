# angleVector

- _angleVector(aNumber)_

Answer the `List` representing the two-dimensional unit vector at angle _aNumber_,
in radians,
relative to the _x_-axis.

Unit vector at angle one-sixth of `pi`:

```
>>> 1/6.pi.angleVector
[3.sqrt / 2, 1/2]
```

Unit vector at angle 30Â°:

```
>>> 30.degree.angleVector
[3.sqrt / 2, 1/2]
```

Unit vector at angle _pi / 3_:

```
>>> 1/3.pi.angleVector
[1/2, 3.sqrt / 2]
```

Equal answer given degrees:

```
>>> 60.degree.angleVector
[1/2, 3.sqrt / 2]
```

C.f. `vector` at `PlaneAngle`:

```
>>> PlaneAngle(60.degree).vector
[1/2, 3.sqrt / 2]
```
