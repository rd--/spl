- _kurenniemiNotation(pitchList)_

Answer a `LineDrawing` showing the _pitchList_ using Kurenniemiâ€™s notation.

Staff and ledger lines are drawn in logarithmic space,
and pitches are drawn at precisely their pitch,
relative to C1 (the pitch three octaves below middle C).

> This system of notation does not use any accidentals. [...] Observe
> that the spaces between staff lines are unequal. In the narrow space
> there is room for two pitch levels, in the large for
> three. (Kurenniemi 2015, p. 5)

Draw the twelve pitches of the `divisors` set of sixty:

The pitches in the drawing are _C1 C2 C3_, _G2 G3 G4_, _E3 E4 E5_ and _B4 B5 B6_.
Note that _G3_ is midway between the _F3_ and _A3_ lines,
there is space below for _F#3_ and space above for _G#3_.
