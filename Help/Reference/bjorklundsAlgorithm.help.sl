# bjorklundsAlgorithm

- _bjorklundsAlgorithm(k, n)_

Bjorklundâ€™s algorithm to construct a binary sequence of _n_ bits with _k_ ones,
such that the _k_ ones are distributed as evenly as possible among the _n - k_ zeroes.

```
>>> 3.bjorklundsAlgorithm(8)
[1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0]

>>> 5.bjorklundsAlgorithm(13)
[1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0]
```

Corresponds to moment of symmetry scale structures.
Consider:

```
>>> 7.bjorklundsAlgorithm(12)
[1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0]
```

Rewriting as the intervals between ones gives _2 1 2 2 1 2 2_,
which is a rotation of:

```
>>> 7.momentOfSymmetry(12).last
[2 2 2 1 2 2 1]
```

The two forms have the same least rotation:

```
>>> [2 1 2 2 1 2 2; 2 2 2 1 2 2 1].collect(
>>> 	lexicographicallyLeastRotation:/1
>>> )
[1 2 2 1 2 2 2; 1 2 2 1 2 2 2]
```
