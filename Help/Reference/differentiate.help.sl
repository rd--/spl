# differentiate

- _differentiate([x₁ x₂ …])_

A slight variant on `differences`,
the first value in the answer is the difference from `zero`.

```
>>> [1 3 6 10 15].differentiate
[1 2 3 4 5]

>>> [-3 0 3 6 9].differentiate
[-3 3 3 3 3]
```

See also `differences`:

```
>>> [1 3 6 10 15].differences
[2 3 4 5]
```
