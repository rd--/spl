# ~ (tilde)

- _p ~ q_

The operator form of `similar`.

```
>>> 1.e ~ 2.7183
similar(1.e, 2.7183)
```

The name of this operator is `tilde`.

Where supported `~` is displayed as ≈.

_Rationale_:
Writing _~_ to indicate _similar to_ is a standard mathematical notation,
as is writing _≈_ to indicate _approximately_.
In Smalltalk `~=` is the operator for _not equal to_, and `~~` is the operator for _not identical to_.
In Sᴘʟ these operators are written `!=` and `!==`,
in order to allow writing `!~` as _not similar to_.
