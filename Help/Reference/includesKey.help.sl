# includesKey

- _includesKey(d, k)_

Answer whether the dictionary _d_ has a key equal to _k_.

```
>>> (Italie: 'Rome', France: 'Paris').includesKey('France')
true
```

_Rationale:_
The indices of dictionaries are called keys.
`includesKey` is another name for `includesIndex`,
and `keys` is another name for `indices`.
