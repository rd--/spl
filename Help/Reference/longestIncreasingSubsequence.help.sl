# longestIncreasingSubsequence

- _longestIncreasingSubsequence(aSequence)_

Answer the longest ascending sequence of contiguous or disjoint elements in _aSequence_.

Find the longest ordered substring, in this case formed by contiguous characters:

```
>>> 'BAABCA'
>>> .longestIncreasingSubsequence
'ABC'
```

and in this case formed by non-contiguous characters:

```
>>> 'BAACBC'
>>> .longestIncreasingSubsequence
'ABC'
```

Find the longest ascending sequence of elements in a list:

```
>>> [2 8 9 5 6 7 1]
>>> .longestIncreasingSubsequence
[2 5 6 7]

>>> [3 2 6 4 5 1]
>>> .longestIncreasingSubsequence
[2 4 5]

>>> [
>>> 	0 8 4 12 2 10 6 14 1 9
>>> 	5 13 3 11 7 15
>>> ].longestIncreasingSubsequence
[0 2 6 9 11 15]

>>> [
>>> 	6 0 0 4 4 7 6 6 9 5
>>> ].longestIncreasingSubsequence
[0 4 6 9]

>>> [2 9 4 7 3 4 5]
>>> .longestIncreasingSubsequence
[2 3 4 5]

>>> [
>>> 	6 3 4 8 10 5 7 1 9 2
>>> ].longestIncreasingSubsequence
[3 4 5 7 9]

>>> [
>>> 	7 4 4 5 2 7 1 8 13 2
>>> 	10 4 9 1 4 5 5 4 3 10
>>> 	3 4 5 8 15 7 11 19
>>> ].longestIncreasingSubsequence
[1 2 3 4 5 7 11 19]
```
