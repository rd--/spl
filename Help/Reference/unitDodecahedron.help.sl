- _unitDodecahedron([x y z])_

Answer a `Polyhedron` of the unit regular dodecahedron at center _(x,y,z)_.

Count the number of vertices, faces and edges,
show that each face is of four vertices,
and that each edge as a unit:

```
>>> let p = [0 0 0].unitDodecahedron;
>>> (
>>> 	p.vertexCount,
>>> 	p.faceCount,
>>> 	p.edgeCount,
>>> 	p.faceIndices.collect(size:/1),
>>> 	p.edgeLengths
>>> )
(20, 12, 30, 5 # 12, 1 # 30)
```

Draw the _xy_ projection of the unit dodecahedron:

~~~spl svg=A
[0 0 0]
.unitDodecahedron
.asPerspectiveDrawing { :each |
	let [x, y, z] = each;
	[x, y]
}
~~~

Draw an axonometric projection of the unit dodecahedron:

~~~spl svg=B
[0 0 0]
.unitDodecahedron
.asPerspectiveDrawing
~~~
