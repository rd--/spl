# square

- _square(n)_

Answer the number _n_ multiplied by itself.

```
>>> (3 * 3, 3 ^ 2, 3.square)
(9, 9, 9)
```

At `List`:

```
>>> [1 2 3 4].square
[1 4 9 16]
```

The inverse is `sqrt`:

```
>>> 3.square.sqrt
3
```

Threads over lists:

```
>>> 1:9.sum.square
2025

>>> [1 11 111 1111].square
[1 121 12321 1234321]
```

More generally, the difference of the squares of two numbers is the product of their sum and their difference:

```
>>> let a = 47;
>>> let b = 53;
>>> a.square - b.square
(a + b) * (a - b)
```

The sum of the n first square numbers,
the square pyramidal numbers:

```
>>> 0:15.collect { :n |
>>> 	n * (n + 1) * ((2 * n) + 1)
>>> } / 6
[
	   0    1    5   14   30
	  55   91  140  204  285
	 385  506  650  819 1015
	1240
]
```

Where supported `square` is displayed as ².
