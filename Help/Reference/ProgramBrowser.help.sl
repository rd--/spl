# ProgramBrowser

A `ColumnBrowser` where:

- column one lists the kinds of programs the system knows of
- column two shows the initials of the authors of the programs of the selected kind
- column three shows the names of the programs by the selected author

When a program is selected the text pane shows the definition.
The context menu of the `TextEditor` can be used to play the program, and to reset the synthesiser when done.
