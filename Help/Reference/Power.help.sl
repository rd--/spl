# Power

- _Power(x, y)_

Answer _x_ raised to the power _y_,
with the same meaning as `symmetricPower`,
which is the meaning of the `Power` operator unit generator of the SuperCollider synthesiser.

```
>>> Power(2, 3)
8

>>> -0.25.Power(0.75)
-0.353553

>>> 0 - (0.25 ^ 0.75)
-0.353553

>>> -0.25J0 ^ 0.75
-0.25J0.25
```
