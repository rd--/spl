# degrees

- _degrees(x)_

At `Angle` answer the value of `Angle` in degrees:

```
>>> Angle(0.5.pi).degrees
90
```

See also `degree`, which answers the angle in radians directly:

```
>>> 90.degree
0.5.pi

>>> 30.degree
(1 / 6).pi
```

See also `degreesToRadians`:

```
>>> 30.degreesToRadians
(1 / 6).pi

>>> 30.degree
(1 / 6).pi
```
