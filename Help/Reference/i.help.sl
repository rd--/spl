# i

- _i(x)_

Answer a `Complex` number with a real part of `zero` and an imaginary part of _x_.
`i` is the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of negative one.

```
>>> 1.i
0J1

>>> -1.sqrt
1.i

>>> 3 + 1.i
3J1
```

At `Complex`:

```
>>> 2J3.i
-3J2
```

Threads over lists:

```
>>> [3 -4 6].i
[0J3 0J-4 0J6]
```
