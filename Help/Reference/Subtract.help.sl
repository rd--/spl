# Subtract

- _Subtract(m, n)_

`Subtract` is an alias for the binary operator `-`,
which is named `hyphenMinus`.

At `SmallFloat`:

```
>>> Subtract(3, 4)
-1

>>> 3 - 4
-1

>>> hyphenSubtract(3, 4)
-1
```

It answers the sum of _m_ and the negation of _n_:

```
>>> Plus(3, Negate(4))
-1

>>> 3 + -4
-1
```
