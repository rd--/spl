# >> (greaterThanSignGreaterThanSign)

- _i >> j_

The operator form or `bitShiftRight`.

```
>>> 48 >> 4
3

>>> 2r110000 >> 4
2r000011

>>> 48.bitShiftRight(4)
3
```

Shift right by `one` is equivalent to `//` by two:

```
>>> (8 >> 1, 8 // 2)
(4, 4)

>>> (7 >> 1, 6 >> 1)
(3, 3)

>>> (2r111 >> 1, 2r110 >> 1)
(2r11, 2r11)

>>> (7 // 2, 6 // 2)
(3, 3)
```

Signed and unsigned shifts:

```
>>> 5 >> 2
1

>>> -5 >> 2
-2
```

Compare with `>>>` (unsigned right shift):

```
>>> -5 >>> 2
1073741822
```

`>>` is also a syntax token used when writing `Documentation Tests`.

Where supported `>>` is displayed as ≫.

The name of this operator is `greaterThanSignGreaterThanSign`.
