- _degree(aNumber)_

Answer _aNumber_ times _degree_, the constant representing the number of radians in one degree,
approximately equal to _0.01745_.

```
>>> 1.degree
(2.pi / 360)

>>> 360.degree
2.pi
```

One degree is divided into sixty _arc minutes_,
which are in turn divided into sixty _arc seconds_:

```
>>> 1.degree
60.arcMinute

>>> 1.degree
(60 * 60).arcSecond
```

Where supported `degree` is displayed as °.
