# Scientific Notation

The _scientific notation_ for a number is an expression of the form _m * (10 ^ n)_.
_m_ is called the coefficient and _n_ is called the exponent.
_m_ may be fractional, _n_ is required to be an integer.
In normalized or standard notation the value of _m_ is in the range _1 <= m < 10_.
One thousand is written _1 * (10 ^ 3)_, and one thousandth _1 * (10 ^ -3)_.

_E notation_ writes this number as _mEn_.
One thousand is written _1E3_, and one thousandth _1E-3_.

The _E_ may be written in either upper or lower case,
the Sᴘʟ standard libraries and help files write the E capitalised.

Engineering notation is a specific form of scientific notation where the exponent _n_ is restricted to multiples of three.

Both integer and floating point numbers may be written in E notation,
the answer is in both cases a `SmallFloat` value:

```
>>> 1E0
1

>>> 1E1
10

>>> 1E2
100

>>> 1E3
1000

>>> 1 * (10 ^ 3)
1000

>>> 1E-3
0.001

>>> 1 * (10 ^ -3)
0.001
```

The Planck length in metres:

```
>>> 1.6E-35
1.6 * (10 ^ -35)
```

The Avogadro number:

```
>>> 6.022E23
6.022 * (10 ^ 23)
```

The parser does not require that _1 <= a < 10_:

```
>>> 10E2
1E3
```
