# | -- logic operator

- _aBoolean | aProcedure_
- _or(aBoolean, aProcedure)_

true if _aBoolean_ is true or _aProcedure_ evaluates to true, else false.
If _aBoolean_ is true then _aProcedure_ is not evaluated.

Where supported _or_ is displayed as ∨.

Note that _|_ is not displayed as ∨because it is part of the [Procedure Syntax].
