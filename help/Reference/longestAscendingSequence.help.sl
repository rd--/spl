# longestAscendingSequence

- longestAscendingSequence(aSequence)_

Answer the longest ascending sequence of contiguous or disjoint elements in _aSequence_.

Find the longest ordered substring, in this case formed by contiguous characters:

```
>>> 'BAABCA'.longestAscendingSequence
'ABC'
```

Find the longest ordered sequence of elements in a list:

```
>>> [3 2 6 4 5 1].longestAscendingSequence
[2 4 5]

>>> [0 8 4 12 2 10 6 14 1 9 5 13 3 11 7 15].longestAscendingSequence
[0 2 6 9 11 15]

>>> [6 0 0 4 4 7 6 6 9 5].longestAscendingSequence
[0 4 6 9]
```
