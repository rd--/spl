# Set

- _Set()_

A collection of objects without duplicates.
The comparison operator is `==`, not `=`, i.e. `Set` is an identity set, not an equality set.
The empty set constructor:

```
>>> Set().size
0
```

Set predicate:

```
>>> Set().isSet
true
```

Note:
`Set` is what Smalltalk calls _IdentitySet_.
