# Association

- _Association(key, value)_
- _key -> value_ => _Association(key, value)_

An `Association` is a type that connects a _key_ with a _value_.

Instances are ordinarily entries in a `Dictionary` type, i.e. `Map` or `Record`.

Equality considers both _key_ & _value_, unlike in Smalltalk-80.
In a `Dictionary` context there cannot be duplicate keys, hence considering only key for equality.
