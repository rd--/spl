# Association

- _Association(key, value)_

An _Association_ is a type that connects a _key_ with a _value_.

Instances are ordinarily entries in a _Dictionary_ type, i.e. _Map_ or _Record_.

Equality considers both _key_ & _value_, unlike in Smalltalk-80.
In a Dictionary context there cannot be duplicate keys, hence considering only key for equality.
