# septimalComma

- _septimalComma(aNumber)_

Answer _aNumber_ times the septimal comma.

The septimal comma is the interval with the square superparticular ratio 64/63.

```
>>> 1.septimalComma
64/63
```

It is the difference between the two superparticular ratios 8/7 and 9/8:

```
>>> 8/7 / 9/8
1.septimalComma
```

and between 81/16 and 5/1:

```
>>> 16/9 / 7/4
1.septimalComma
```

It has lattice coordinates _[6 -2 0 -1>_:

```
>>> 1.septimalComma.factorInteger
[2 -> 6, 3 -> -2, 7 -> -1]
```
