# Bitset

A Bitset is a dictionary-like data structures mapping 0-1 values to integers between 0 and capacity-1.

Bitsets implement three different kind of protocols,
each corresponding to a way of thinking about this data structure:

- A _Set_-like protocol with _add_, _remove_ and _includes_.
- A _Dictionary_-like protocl with _at_ and _atPut_.
- A bit-manipulation protocol with _bitAt_, _clearBitAt_ and _setBitAt_
