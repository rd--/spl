# :=

:= is a syntax token, it is not an operator.

:= separates the variable name and the expression in `Assignment Syntax`.

```
>>> var x;
>>> x := 3;
>>> x * x
9
```

The _:=_ symbol is also part of `AtPut Syntax` and `Quoted AtPut Syntax`.

Where supported this operator is displayed either as a leftwards arrow, ←,
or as a colon equals glyph, ≔.
