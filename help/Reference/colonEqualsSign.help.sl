# :=

:= is a syntax token, it is not an operator.

:= separates the variable name and the expression in [Assignment Syntax].

```
>>> var x;
>>> x := 3;
>>> x * x
9
```

The _:=_ symbol is also part of [AtPut Syntax] and [Quoted AtPut Syntax].

Where supported this operator is displayed either as a leftwards arrow, ←,
or as a colon equals glyph, ≔.
