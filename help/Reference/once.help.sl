# once

- _once(aBlock:/0)_
- _once(aBlock, where, key)_ ‚üπ cached(where, key, aBlock)

Evaluate _aBlock_, on the first occasion store the result in a system wide cache keyed by _aBlock_ and on subsequent evaluations answer that value.

The cache is a _WeakMap_ so once _aBlock_ is reclaimed the cached answer will be reclaimed.

The ternary form is an idiom re-ordering the arguments to _cached_.
