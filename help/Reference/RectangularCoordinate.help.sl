# RectangularCoordinate

_RectangularCoordinate(x, y)_

A coordinate in two-dimensional Cartesian space given by an ordered pair _(x, y)_.

> The two axes of two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates,
> conventionally denoted the x- and y-axes (a notation due to
> Descartes), are chosen to be linear and mutually
> perpendicular. Typically, the x-axis is thought of as the horizontal
> axis while the y-axis is thought of as the vertical axis.
