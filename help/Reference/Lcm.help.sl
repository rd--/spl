# Lcm

- _Lcm(aNumber, anotherNumber)_

Least common multiple.

This definition extends the usual definition and returns a negative number if any of the operands is negative.
This makes it consistent with the lattice-theoretical interpretation and itâ€™s idempotency, commutative, associative, absorption laws.

```
>>> 1624.Lcm(-26)
-21112

>>> -1624.Lcm(-26)
-21112

>>> 513.Lcm(513.Gcd(44))
513
```

Following the example of the programming language _J_, `Lcm` is analogous to logical and:

```
>>> Lcm:/2.table([0 1], [0 1])
[0 0; 0 1]

>>> &&.table([false true], [false true])
[false false; false true]
```

Mouse control of frequency:

```
let mx = MouseX(-200, 200, 0, 0.2);
let my = MouseY(-200, 200, 0, 0.2);
let freq = SinOsc(0.3, 0) * 20.Lcm([mx, my]) * 30 + 500;
SinOsc(freq, 0) * 0.1
```
