# Url

`Url` is both a `Trait` and a `Type` representing a _Uniform Resource Locator_.

`Url` values are constructed using `asUrl`.

`Url` implements the `hash`, `host`, `hostName`, `href`, `origin`, `pathName`, `port`, `protocol` and `search` methods.

_Note_:
The type has the non-standard spelling _URL_, which is defined by the system.
