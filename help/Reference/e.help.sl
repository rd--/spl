- _e(aNumber)_

The number `e`, also known as Euler’s number or Napier’s constant, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.
It is the base of natural logarithms.

Answer _aNumber_ times e.

```
>>> 1.e
2.71828

>>> 2.e
5.43656
```

`e` threads over lists:

```
>>> [0.5, 1.5].e
[1.35914, 4.07742]
```

`e` is also defined as a constant:

```
>>> e * 3
8.15485
```

_e_ is also a part of the _E Notation_ for `Number Literals`.
