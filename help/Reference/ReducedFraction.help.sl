# ReducedFraction

- _ReducedFraction(numerator, denominator)_

Answer a `Fraction` where it is known that _numerator/denominator_ is already a reduced fraction.

This method is used to avoid the cost of reducing Fractions that are know to be in a reduced form.

It can be used to make `Fraction` values that do not conform to the required invariants,
and which may result in undefined behaviour.
