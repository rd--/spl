# Stack

A simple stack `Type`.  The protocol is:

- `push` adds a new object of any kind on top of the stack
- `pop` answers the first element and removes it from the stack
- `top` answer the first element of the stack without removing it

Implemented in terms of `LinkedList`,
`push` is `addFirst`, `pop` is `removeFirst`.
