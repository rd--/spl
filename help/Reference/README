The Spl "Reference" files follow a few simple rules.

Terse DocTest entries are any number of _>>>_ prefixed lines followed by one _answer_ line.
DocTests are written so that the _>>>_ prefixed lines,
when unprefixed and concatenated,
evaluate to a value that is _~_ to the answer line.

_Indented Code Blocks_ should contain only lines that each evaluate to a Boolean.

The _terseReferenceSummary_ method will extract both of these kinds of tests,
evaluate them all,
note any errors,
and summarise the result.
All other examples should be given in _Fenced Code Blocks_.

Below the horizontal rule there may be the following entries:

- "See also:" indicates a list of help files to consult
- "References:" indicates external references (Apl, Mathematica, SuperCollider)
- "Categories:" indicates which categories the entry should be listed in
- "Unicode:" glyphs related to the entry
