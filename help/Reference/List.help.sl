# List

- _List(anInteger)_
- _List(anInteger, anObject)_

Create a new array of _anInteger_ places, each initialised to _nil_, or to _anObject_.

- _List(aCollection)_

Create a new array having as elements the elements of _aCollection_.
If the collection is a List, answer it directly.

Lists are of variable size, elements can be added at the start, at the end, or in a place given by a relation to existing items.

List implements the _Iterable_, _Indexable_, _Collection_, _Sequencable_, _PrimitiveList_ and _Ordered_ traits.
