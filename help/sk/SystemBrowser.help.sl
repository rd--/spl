# SystemBrowser

A _ColumnBrowser_ where:

- column one lists the _Types_ the system knows of
- column two shows the qualified method names for the methods of the selected type

The methods include those defined at the _Traits_ the type implements.

For clarity the methods of the _Object_ trait are omitted from the list.

When a method is selected the text pane shows the definition of the method.

The _Status Text_ shows the _Traits_ the selected type implements.
