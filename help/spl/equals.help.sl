# equals -- comparing

- _equals(self, anObject)_ â‰¡ _self = anObject_

This is the _structural equality_ operator, it answers _true_ if _self_ is equal to _anObject_, else _false_.
The meaning of _equals_ is determined by the _typeOf(self)_.

The _equals_ method is not implemented at _Object_.

The _=_ symbol is also a part of [Initialised Temporaries Syntax] and [Variable Keyword Syntax].
