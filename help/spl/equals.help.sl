# = -- equality operator

- _self = anObject_
- _equals(self, anObject)_

This is the _structural equality_ operator, it answers _true_ if _self_ is equal to _anObject_, else _false_.
The meaning of _equals_ is determined by the _typeOf(self)_.
The _equals_ method is implemented as identity at _Object_.

The _=_ symbol is also a part of [Initialised Temporaries Syntax] and [Variable Keyword Syntax].
