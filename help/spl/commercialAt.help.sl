# commercialAt -- graphics

- _commercialAt(x, y)_ == _x@y_

This operator is the point constructor in Smalltalk.

```
0@0 = Point(0,0)
```

This is not given the simpler name of _at_ since that is the name of the lookup and indexing method in Smalltalk, and has it's own syntax.

```
var c = [1, 2, 3]; c.at(2) = c[2]
```
