# Character -- text type

- _Character(anInteger)_
- _Character(aString)_

A Character can be constructed either from a single character string, or from a unicode code point.

The _codePoint_ method retrieves the unicode code point and the _string_ method retrieves the single element string.

	'x'.Character.codePoint = 120
	120.Character.string = 'x'

There is no literal syntax for characters.
