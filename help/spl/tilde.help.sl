# ~ -- comparing

- _aMagnitude ~ anotherMagnitude_

Answer true is _aMagnitude_ is almost equal to _anotherMagnitude_, else false.

_Rationale_:
Writing ~ to indicate _similar to_ is a standard mathematical notation,
as is writing ≈ to indicate _approximately_.
However the notation is a little confusing in this context.
In Smalltalk ~= is the operator for _not equal to_, and ~~ is the operator for _not identical to_.
If these operators were written != and !== it may be less confusing.
