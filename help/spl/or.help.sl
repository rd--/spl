# | -- logic operator

- _aBoolean | aProcedure:/0_
- _or(aBoolean, aProcedure:/0)_

true if _aBoolean_ is true or _aProcedure_ evaluates to true, else false.
If _aBoolean_ is true then _aProcedure_ is not evaluated.

Where supported _or_ is displayed as ∨.

Note that _|_ is not displayed as ∨ because it is part of the [Procedure Syntax].

_Note:_
In Smalltalk _|_ and _or_ have different behaviour,
the former is _evaluating_ and the latter not.
If _|_ were named _verticalBar_ this behaviour could be adopted.
