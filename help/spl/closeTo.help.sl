# closeTo -- comparing

- _closeTo(aNumber, anotherNumber)_
- _aNumber ~ anotherNumber_

Answer true is _aNumber_ is close to _anotherNumber_, else false.

_Rationale_:
The use of ~ as the operator to indicate _similar to_ is a standard mathematical notation.
However it is a little confusing in this context because in Smalltalk ~= is the binary operator for _not equal to_,
and ~~ is the binary operator for _not identical to_.
