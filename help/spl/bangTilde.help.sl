# !~ -- comparing

- _aMagnitude !~ anotherMagnitude_

Answer true is _aMagnitude_ is similar to _anotherMagnitude_, else false.

_Rationale_:
Writing ~ to indicate _similar to_ is a standard mathematical notation.
However it is a little confusing in this context.
In Smalltalk ~= is the operator for _not equal to_, and ~~ is the operator for _not identical to_.
If these operators were written != and !== then !~ could indicate _not similar to_.
