# Stack -- collection type

A simple stack.  The protocol is:

- _push_ adds a new object of any kind on top of the stack
- _pop_ answers the first element and removes it from the stack
- _top_ answer the first element of the stack without removing it

Implemented in terms of LinkedList,
_push_ is _addFirst_, _pop_ is _removeFirst_.
