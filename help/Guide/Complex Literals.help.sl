# Complex Literals

A complex number is a number consisting of a _real_ and an _imaginary_ component.

Complex numbers may be written as literals using the syntax _rJi_,
i.e. `3J4` or `2J3`.

```
>>> 3J4
Complex(3, 4)

>>> 2J3
Complex(2, 3)
```

The rewrite rule is _rJi => Complex(r, i)_.

The _J_ may also be written _j_.
