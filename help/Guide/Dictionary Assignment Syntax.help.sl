# Dictionary Assignment Syntax -- syntax

There is dictionary assignment syntax for both temporary variable initialisers:

```
>>> let (x, y, z) = (x: 1 * 2, y: 3 * 4, z: 5 * 6);
>>> [z, y, x]
[30, 12, 2]
```

and for variable assignment:

```
>>> var x, y, z;
>>> (x, y, z) := (x: 1 * 2, y: 3 * 4, z: 5 * 6);
>>> [z, y, x]
[30, 12, 2]
```

* * *
