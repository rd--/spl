# Matrix Syntax

Rewrite rule:

- _[p q ...; r s ...; ...]_ â‰¡ _[[p, q ...], [r, s ...], ...]_

Allows writing matrices (two dimensional arrays) as a sequence of [Vector Syntax] entries separated by semicolons.

```
>>> [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

This is particularly useful as a part of [Volume Syntax].

There is no syntax for writing an empty field.
