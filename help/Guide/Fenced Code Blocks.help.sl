# Fenced Code Blocks

In _Markdown_
(and _CommonMark_ in particular)
a _fenced code block_ is a section of the document written between matching _code fences_.

A _code fence_ is a sequence of at least three consecutive grave accent characters ('```') or tilde characters ('~~~').
Tildes and backticks cannot be mixed.
