# SuperCollider Perspective

Block arguments are written `:` prefixed immediately following the opening brace and are terminated by `|`.

Initialized temporary variables are written using `let`.

The assignment operator is `:=` not `=`.

The equality operator is `=` not `==`.

The identity operator is `==` not `===`.

The inequality operator is `~=` not `!=`.
