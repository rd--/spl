# Block Syntax

The _Block_ syntax follows Smalltalkâ€™s.

Braces (`{` and `}`) replace brackets (`[` and `]`),
and semi-colons (`;`) replace periods (`.`).

The general form is

> _{ arguments? temporaries? statements? }_

A no argument block that returns a random number between -1 and 1 is written

> _{ randomFloat(-1, 1) }_

Arguments are written with a colon (`:`) prefix directly following the open brace and are terminated by a vertical bar (`|`).

The one argument block to square a number is written

> _{ :n | n * n }_

The two argument sum of squares block is written

> _{ :x :y | (x * x) + (y * y) }_

Temporaries are written using a `var` keyword, statements are separated by semi-colons.

A one argument block that returns two random numbers, the second constrained by the first, is written

> _{ :n | var i, j; i := randomFloat(0, n); j := randomFloat(0, i); [i, j] }_

There is no return operator, the value of a block is the value of the last statement.

_Subtleties:_
If _p.q_ is a block, it must be applied as _(p.q) . (r)_, which is usually written _p.q.value(r)_.
_p.q(r)_ is _q(p, r)_, not _(q(p))(r)_.
