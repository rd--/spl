# Block Semantics

_Block_ has the semantics of Smalltalk's _BlockClosure_, which is a form of Scheme's _lambda_.

> _Semantics:_
> A lambda expression evaluates to a procedure.
> The environment in effect when the lambda expression was evaluated is remembered as part of the procedure.
> When the procedure is later called with some actual arguments,
> the environment in which the lambda expression was evaluated will be extended by
> binding the variables in the formal argument list to fresh locations,
> the corresponding actual argument values will be stored in those locations,
> and the expressions in the body of the lambda expression will be evaluated sequentially in the extended environment.
> The result of the last expression in the body will be returned as the result of the procedure call.

Blocks have fixed arity, they must be applied to the number of arguments they require.

Temporary variables are initialised to _nil_.

The block _numArgs_ reports the arity of a block.

The _cull_ family of blocks (as in Smalltalk) selectively apply a block to fewer arguments, using  _numArgs_ to ignore excess parameters.
