# Assignment, initialisation, equality, identity

The `Assignment Syntax` is _p := q_.

```
>>> var x;
>>> x := 1;
>>> x
1
```

The `Initialised Temporaries Syntax` is _let p = q;_.

```
>>> let x = 1;
>>> x
1
```

The standard library defines the equality predicate as _p = q_ and the identity predicate as _p == q_.

```
>>> 3 + 4 = 7
true

>>> 3 + 4 == 7
true
```
