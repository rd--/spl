# Tuple Syntax

Tuples are written between parenthesis brackets.
Tuple items are separated by commas.

A three tuple of integers:

```
>>> (1, 2, 3)
(1, 2, 3)
```

A three tuple of expressions:

```
>>> (1 + 2, 3 * 4, 25.sqrt)
(3, 12, 5)
```

There is no syntax for writing either the empty tuple or the one-tuple.

```
>>> ().isRecord
true

>>> (1).isInteger
true
```
