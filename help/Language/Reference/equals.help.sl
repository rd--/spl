# equals -- comparing

- _anObject = anotherObject_
_ _p = q_ ‚üπ _equals(p, q)_

This is the _structural equality_ operator, it answers _true_ if _anObject_ is equal to _anotherObject_, else _false_.
The meaning of _equals_ is determined by the _typeOf(self)_.

The _equals_ method is not implemented at _Object_.

The _=_ symbol is also a part of [Initialised Temporaries Syntax] and [Variable Keyword Syntax].
