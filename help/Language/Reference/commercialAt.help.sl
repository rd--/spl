# @ -- graphics

- _aNumber @ anotherNumber_
- _p & q_ ‚üπ _commercialAt(p, q)_

This operator is the point constructor in Smalltalk.

	0@0 = Point(0,0)

_Rationale_:
This operator is not given the simpler name of _at_ because that is the name of the lookup and indexing method in Smalltalk.

	let c = [1, 2, 3]; c.at(2) = 2

We want to ensure that the following is an error:

	let n = 23; { n[3] }.ifError { true }

We do however wish to have operator forms for variants of at,
such as atAll and atPath, and @* is a nice mnemonic for atAll.

	let c = [1 .. 9]; c @ 3 = 3
	let c = [1 .. 9]; c @* [3, 5, 7] = [3, 5, 7]

* * *
