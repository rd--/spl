# CylindricalCoordinate -- geometry type

The three components (ρ, φ, z) of a CylindricalCoordinate _p_ are:

- the radial distance ρ (or r) is the Euclidean distance from the z-axis to _p_
- the azimuth φ (or theta)is the angle of the line from the origin to the projection of _p_ on the plane
- the axial coordinate z is the signed distance from the plane to the point _p_
