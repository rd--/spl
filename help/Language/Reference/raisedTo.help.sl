# ^ -- mathematical operator

- _aNumber ^ anotherNumber_
- _p ^ q_ ⟹ _raisedTo(p, q)_

Answer _aNumber_ raised to the power of _anotherNumber_.

_Note:_
In Smalltalk ^ is the _return_ operator, in C it is the _exclusive or_ operator.
This raisedTo operator is sometimes written **, where supported ** is displayed as ⇈.
