# ~= -- comparing

- _anObject ~= anotherObject_
- p ~= q ⟹ _tildeEquals(p, q)_

This is the _structural inequality_ operator,
it answers _false_ if _anObject_ is equal to _anotherObject_, else _true_.
The meaning of _notEquals_ is determined by the _typeOf(anObject)_.

Where supported this operator is displayed as ≠.
