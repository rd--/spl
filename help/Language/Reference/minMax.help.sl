# minMax -- math

- _minMax(aCollection)_
- _minMax(aMagnitude, firstMagnitude, secondMagnitude)_

The unary form scans for minimum and maximum in one pass returning the results as a two-element array.

The ternary form takes _aMagnitude_ or _firstMagnitude_, whichever is the lesser magnitude, and answers that or _secondMagnitude_, whichever is the greater magnitude.

_Note:_  This implements both min:max: and minMax of Smalltalk.
